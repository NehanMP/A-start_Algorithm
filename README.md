# A-start_Algorithm
The above program shows a graphical representation of the A* algorithm traversal implemented using java swing. The starting node and the end node should be given and the default column and row size can be changed based on the required projects scope. A KeyListener is implemented for both the methods auto-search and manul-search, where in the auto-search after running the the program it shows the final output with the selected path way while in manul-search it traverse the node one-by-one, so the user can get a clear idea on how the traversal is done between the two node. The below given image is the final output recieved after running the applicationn.
